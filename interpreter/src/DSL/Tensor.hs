------ Selection step:  Sel = Gen x . Sel: for each data-structure, we create an x to represent a site.
------ We could do Gen x. Gen y . , where we create x represent a site, and create y representing another site that is not x.
------ form to n adj sites. manipulation on data-structure. If not, then ID = KeepPos || KeepNeg (but we might want this, since we have penalties adding step).
------ How to properly write two variables, 
------ Gen x. KeepPos x -> ok, 
------ Gen x. Gen y. KeepPos x . KeepPos y --> possibly ok, I mean KeepPos y . KeepPos x are the same. 
------ Gen x. Gen y. Swap [x] . KeepPos y --> ?
------ Gen x. Gen y. Swap [x,y] --> ? meaning that x and y can only be 01 or 10, they cannot be 11, or 00

------Clique finding  having two
------ Gen x. Gen y. KeepPos x . KeepPos y
------ Gen x. Gen y. Swap [x,y]

------Equal Sum
------ in gen choice step, ID means Identity matrix, which means KeepPos x || KeepNeg x
------ Gen x. Swap [x]
------ ID

------ Exact Cover
------ Gen x. Swap [x]
------ ID

------ Sel x = Gen x . Sel x | Spin x | Sel x || Sel x

------ Second problem is with the parallel operation, it means the sum Sel x + Sel x, should I allow it here, or should I put it in the library
------ and say that every allowed selection is ||_n (Sel x), like n parallel operations over Sel x.
------ the simplest case of a datatype for the Spin could be a list or a Stream
------ or we could use cellular automaton


------ genChoice then could become taking the Spin expression V x and map the expression onto all the sites in a system.
------ the problem is with the type
------ type of Gen x . v -> m a -> (a -> b) -> m b.
------ type of Gen x. Gen y. v -> m a -> (a -> a -> b) -> m b

------ Energy step is to add penalties to amplitudes
------ This step is applied to the Spin level. For each Spin operation, we apply a operation dealing with the existing amplitude
------ The assumption is that there is an existing energy. And the energy manipulation is to apply to an energy
------ for example, to implement the Z gate, we apply a negative operation to the existing amplitude
------ for the unspecified cases, the amplitude is identity
------ AppAmp (KeepPos x) = (-)

------ In clique finding step, we need to access the edges between x and y
------ In (*) operation forall case, ID means (*1)
------ AppAmp (KeepPos x . KeepPos y) = if g(x,y) then (* 0) else ID -- load the edge weight between x and y


------ Forall (*) AppAmp 1. -- the equal sum example has a sum of all AppAmp




------exact cover example, accesses three sites, x, y, z.
------the exact cover is just saying, there exists a h
------AppAmp (KeepPos x. KeepNeg y. KeepNeg z) = if h(x,y,z) then (* 0) else ID
------AppAmp (KeepNeg x. KeepPos y. KeepNeg z) = if h(x,y,z) then (* 0) else ID
------AppAmp (KeepNeg x. KeepNeg y. KeepPos z) = if h(x,y,z) then (* 0) else ID
------Forall (*) AppAmp 1. -- the equal sum example has a sum of all AppAmp



------ the final minimization step is to do the adiabatic computation minimize
----miniStep = minimize
------ we need to translate the above expression to matrix in adiabatic evolution
------ for each Spin step, let's split the site to x vs non_x, as (x, x_1, x_2, ....), 
------ for each spin step f(x), we will generate the matrix for x as f(x) tensor I(x_1) tensor I(x_2) tensor ...
------ for all sites, we apply each one of the with a spin-step and generate a tensor, then we linear-sum all of them.
