-- How to properly write two variables, 
-- Gen x. KeepPos x -> ok, 
-- Gen x. Gen y. KeepPos x . KeepPos y --> possibly ok, I mean KeepPos y . KeepPos x are the same. 
-- Gen x. Gen y. Swap [x] . KeepPos y --> ?
-- Gen x. Gen y. Swap [x,y] --> ? meaning that x and y can only be 01 or 10, they cannot be 11, or 00

-- Second problem is with the parallel operation, it means the sum Sel x + Sel x, should I allow it here, or should I put it in the library
-- and say that every allowed selection is ||_n (Sel x), like n parallel operations over Sel x.

-- genChoice then could become taking the Spin expression V x and map the expression onto all the sites in a system.
-- the problem is with the type
type of Gen x . v -> m a -> (a -> b) -> m b.

-- Energy step is to add penalties to amplitudes
-- This step is applied to the Spin level. For each Spin operation, we apply a operation dealing with the existing amplitude
-- The assumption is that there is an existing energy. And the energy manipulation is to apply to an energy
-- for example, to implement the Z gate, we apply a negative operation to the existing amplitude
-- for the unspecified cases, the amplitude is identity
AppAmp (KeepPos x) = (-)

-- In clique finding step, we need to access the edges between x and y
-- In (*) operation forall case, ID means (*1)
AppAmp (KeepPos x . KeepPos y) = if g(x,y) then (* 0) else ID -- load the edge weight between x and y

--equal sum example, just access the x-th element.
-- In (+) operation forall case, ID means (+0)
AppAmp (KeepPos x) = g(x)
AppAmp (KeepNeg x) = - g(x)

--exact cover example, accesses three sites, x, y, z.
--the exact cover is just saying, there exists a h
AppAmp (KeepPos x. KeepNeg y. KeepNeg z) = if h(x,y,z) then (* 0) else ID
AppAmp (KeepNeg x. KeepPos y. KeepNeg z) = if h(x,y,z) then (* 0) else ID

-- the final minimization step is to do the adiabatic computation minimize
miniStep = minimize
-- we need to translate the above expression to matrix in adiabatic evolution
-- for each Spin step, let's split the site to x vs non_x, as (x, x_1, x_2, ....), 
-- for each spin step f(x), we will generate the matrix for x as f(x) tensor I(x_1) tensor I(x_2) tensor ...
-- for all sites, we apply each one of the with a spin-step and generate a tensor, then we linear-sum all of them.
