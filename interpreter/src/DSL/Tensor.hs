-- Second problem is with the parallel operation, it means the sum Sel x + Sel x, should I allow it here, or should I put it in the library
-- and say that every allowed selection is ||_n (Sel x), like n parallel operations over Sel x.
-- the simplest case of a datatype for the Spin could be a list or a Stream
-- or we could use cellular automaton


-- genChoice then could become taking the Spin expression V x and map the expression onto all the sites in a system.
-- the problem is with the type
-- type of Gen x . v -> m a -> (a -> b) -> m b.
-- type of Gen x. Gen y. v -> m a -> (a -> a -> b) -> m b

-- Energy step is to add penalties to amplitudes
-- This step is applied to the Spin level. For each Spin operation, we apply a operation dealing with the existing amplitude
-- The assumption is that there is an existing energy. And the energy manipulation is to apply to an energy
-- for example, to implement the Z gate, we apply a negative operation to the existing amplitude
-- for the unspecified cases, the amplitude is identity
-- AppAmp (KeepPos x) = (-)

-- In clique finding step, we need to access the edges between x and y
-- In (*) operation forall case, ID means (*1)
-- AppAmp (KeepPos x . KeepPos y) = if g(x,y) then (* 0) else ID -- load the edge weight between x and y


-- Forall (*) AppAmp 1. -- the equal sum example has a sum of all AppAmp

-- the final minimization step is to do the adiabatic computation minimize
miniStep = minimize
-- we need to translate the above expression to matrix in adiabatic evolution
-- for each Spin step, let's split the site to x vs non_x, as (x, x_1, x_2, ....), 
-- for each spin step f(x), we will generate the matrix for x as f(x) tensor I(x_1) tensor I(x_2) tensor ...
-- for all sites, we apply each one of the with a spin-step and generate a tensor, then we linear-sum all of them.
