Here is a comprehensive list of approaches to implementing search
strategies within your abstract framework:

üîß Assumptions

Your core abstraction is:

data SearchStrategy m s w choice = SearchStrategy
  { runSearch :: m (s choice) -> (s choice -> (s choice, Double)) -> m (s choice, Double)
  }

Where:
	‚Ä¢	m is the monad of execution or sampling
	‚Ä¢	s is a Traversable container of choice
	‚Ä¢	w is a Comonad used for context-aware evaluation
	‚Ä¢	choice is the domain being optimized at each site

üß† Classes of Search Strategies

1. Sampling-Based Strategies

Work by repeatedly generating candidates from m (s choice), scoring them, and selecting the best.

Strategy	Description
Random sampling	Evaluate N samples, return best
First successful	Return first sample that meets a threshold
Weighted sampling	Probabilistically accept samples based on score (softmax or Boltzmann)
Top-k selection	Return top k samples and pick the best among them
Tournament selection	Compete samples pairwise or groupwise, advance best

2. Exhaustive Strategies (m = [], LogicT, etc.)

Assume candidates :: MonadPlus m => m (s choice) explores entire space.

Strategy	Description
Exhaustive search	Try every configuration, pick global best
Threshold pruning	Cut search branches early if score is too bad
Depth-bounded	Limit maximum recursion or structure size
Lazy greedy	Prefer better paths but continue search (beam search style)

3. Comonad-Based Local Search (structure-aware)

Use extend, duplicate, and extract on s and w.

Strategy	Description
Hill climbing	Move greedily to neighbor with best score
Stochastic hill climbing	Randomly move to a better (not best) neighbor
Simulated annealing	Accept worse solutions with temperature-based probability
Tabu search	Maintain history of visited states to avoid cycles
Local entropy minimization	Collapse structure via entropy-like scoring (e.g. WaveFunctionCollapse)

4. Evolutionary / Population-Based

Maintain and evolve a population of s choice configurations.

Strategy	Description
Genetic algorithms	Apply crossover and mutation to populations
Map-Elites	Maintain diverse elite solutions by feature
Fitness sharing	Penalize similar solutions to encourage diversity
Differential evolution	Use differences between samples to guide changes

5. Constraint-Based / Propagation-Based

Inspired by CSP/SAT/logic programming

Strategy	Description
Backtracking search	Recursively explore valid assignments
Constraint propagation	Eliminate inconsistent values using local consistency
WaveFunctionCollapse	Iteratively collapse low-entropy cells and propagate effects
SAT solving	Encode problem and solve via DPLL/CDCL-like approach

6. Gradient-Based (when applicable)

Only applicable if choice is numeric and differentiable.

Strategy	Description
Gradient descent	Adjust values to reduce error
Evolution strategies	Use gradients implicitly through perturbation
REINFORCE / policy gradients	Learn from rewards (if learning setting)

7. Quantum-Inspired

Mimic quantum processes like annealing or tunneling.

Strategy	Description
Quantum annealing	Use Ising model and simulated annealing to reach ground state
Grover search	Simulate amplitude amplification for fast search
Quantum walks	Simulate coherent exploration of configuration space
Amplitude encoding	Evaluate all solutions in parallel via quantum-style scoring

üîÅ Combinations

You can also hybridize:
	‚Ä¢	Sampling + Local Search: Start with random samples, refine with hill climbing
	‚Ä¢	Propagation + Annealing: Use constraint propagation to shrink the space, then sample/anneal
	‚Ä¢	Comonadic + Evolutionary: Evolve global states while scoring via local comonadic windows

‚∏ª

üß± Implementation Constraints
	‚Ä¢	Sampling requires MonadRandom or IO.
	‚Ä¢	Exhaustive requires MonadPlus or Alternative.
	‚Ä¢	Local search requires Comonad w, Traversable s.
	‚Ä¢	Population strategies require custom state inside m.
	‚Ä¢	Quantum-inspired usually simulate annealing or Ising energy over s choice.
